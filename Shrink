- In active_transaction, you might not be able to shrink and you might need to wait until the transaction is completed. However, after a transaction is completed you won't see the log file truncated immediately. 
- The best reason is "NOTHING"
- After shrink operation, take backup until it shows NOTHING (if full recovery)
